<p align="center">âš¡ An all-in-one managed backend for AI apps. Build AI apps from the frontend, very fast. ðŸª¶</p>

Why use Polyfire?
* Just code from the frontend, no backend needed
* If you already have backend, less code to write
* Most backend services you'd need in a couple lines of code

We **manage your AI backend** so you don't have to.

## ðŸ§° Examples

We have several examples in our [documentation](https://docs.polyfire.com/). But here are two simple ones to get you started

### React

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { PolyfireProvider, usePolyfire } from "polyfire-js/hooks";

function App() {
  const { auth: { login, status }, models: { generate } } = usePolyfire();
  const [haiku, setHaiku] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (status === "authenticated") generate("haiku").then(setHaiku);
  }, [status]);

  if (status === "unauthenticated")
    return <button onClick={() => login("github")}>Login with Github</button>;
  else if (status === "loading" || !haiku) return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
  return <h1>{haiku}</h1>;
}

document.body.innerHTML = '<div id="app"></div>';
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("app"));
root.render(<PolyfireProvider project="your_project_id"><App /></PolyfireProvider>);
```
> Don't forget to change the **your_project_id** by your project ID you will have got on https://beta.polyfire.com

### Vanilla JS

```html
<script src="https://github.com/polyfire-ai/polyfire-js/releases/download/0.2.7/polyfire-min-0.2.7.js"></script>
<script>
	(async () => {
		const polyfire = window.PolyfireClientBuilder({ project: "your_project_id" })
		
		const isAuthenticated = await polyfire.auth.init();
		if (!isAuthenticated) {
		  await polyfire.auth.login("github")
		}
		
		const helloWorld = await polyfire.models.generate("Write me a hello world haiku");
		console.log(helloWorld);
	})()
</script>
